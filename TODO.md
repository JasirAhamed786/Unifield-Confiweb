# TODO List for Crop Image Implementation

- [x] Expand backend/seed.js with additional 40 crops (total 50) including imageUrl from Unsplash
- [x] Modify client/src/components/CropLibrary.jsx to use dynamic crop.imageUrl instead of hardcoded cropImages
- [x] Update client/src/components/CropDetail.jsx to display crop image using crop.imageUrl
- [ ] Run seed script to populate database
- [ ] Test web app for image display in CropLibrary and CropDetail
